# WebRTC P2P and Mesh Experiment

Welcome to my WebRTC project! This is my first attempt at using WebRTC to explore peer-to-peer (P2P) and mesh networking.

## Overview

This project aims to create a real-time communication platform using WebRTC, enabling direct P2P connections and experimenting with mesh networking architectures.

## Features

- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication
- Mesh Networking
- Real-Time Data and Media Streaming

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mubbashirhussain/webrtc.git
   cd webrtc
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open Your Browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to start experimenting with P2P and mesh networking.
